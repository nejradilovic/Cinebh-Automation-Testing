# Cinebh Automation Testing

This repository contains automation tests for **Cinebh**, an application designed for buying and reserving movie tickets. The goal is to verify the functionality of the application through automated API testing and smoke tests. The application allows users to view movies, purchase tickets, and make reservations. The testing ensures that the features work correctly and that the system handles different scenarios as expected.

The project includes two types of automated tests:
1. **API Tests**: These tests use Axios to send requests to the backend of the Cinebh app, verifying that the API endpoints respond correctly. The main focus is on testing the functionality and data integrity of various API controllers.
2. **Smoke Test**:  An end-to-end test, implemented using the **Jasmine** framework, to ensure the core features of the application are working.
